//  Orchestrates a full Gemini Live conversation session:
//    1. Opens a WebSocket to Gemini via GeminiLiveClient
//    2. Captures mic audio with AVAudioEngine, converts to PCM16 16kHz,
//       and streams it over the WebSocket
//    3. Sends a screenshot at session start so Gemini can see the screen
//    4. Plays back audio responses in real time via GeminiLiveAudioPlayer
//    5. Routes Gemini's CUA action plan tool calls
//       to CompanionManager via callbacks
