//
//  GeminiLiveClient.swift
//  TipTour
//
//  WebSocket client for Google's Gemini Live API. Single bidirectional
//  streaming connection that handles voice input, vision input, voice
//  output, and text transcription in one model — plus in-stream tool
//  calls for pointing + workflow planning.
//
//  Connection lifecycle:
//  1. connect() opens the WebSocket and sends the initial config message
//  2. Server responds with {"setupComplete": {}} — only then can we send data
//  3. sendAudioChunk() streams PCM16 16kHz mono audio (from the mic)
//  4. sendScreenshot() sends a JPEG frame (max 1 fps per docs)
//  5. Server streams back audio (PCM16 24kHz), input/output transcripts,
//     and turn lifecycle events (turnComplete, interrupted, etc.)
//
