//
//  WorkflowRunner.swift
//  TipTour
//
//  Executes one WorkflowPlan action at a time:
//    • Resolves the active step's element via ElementResolver and flies
//      the cursor there.
//    • Arms ClickDetector on the resolved target (preferring the real
//      AX rect over a fixed radius) so a real user click advances the
//      current action automatically in Teaching mode.
//    • Retries resolution with a budget instead of giving up silently
//      when an element hasn't appeared yet — a menu that's still
//      animating open should not stall the runner.
//    • Stamps every plan with a fresh `operationToken` (UUID) so a
//      stale advance callback firing after a rapid restart cannot move
//      a different plan forward.
//    • Pauses automatically when the user Cmd-Tabs to an unrelated
//      app, when a modal sheet/dialog appears mid-workflow, or when
//      the post-click AX-tree hash didn't change at all (the click
//      almost certainly missed).
//
//  These robustness behaviors are deliberate ports of the
//  Planner/Executor/Validator triad pattern: the executor is the
//  cursor flight + click arm, the validator is the post-click AX-hash
//  diff. We don't have a full external planner — Gemini emits the
//  whole plan up-front — but the validator boundary still buys us
//  cheap reliability without an extra LLM call on the hot path.
