//  Cheap perceptual hash (dHash) for telling whether two screenshots show
//  a meaningfully different scene. The hash is a 64-bit fingerprint
//  computed from a 9x8 grayscale downscale; comparing two hashes by
//  Hamming distance gives a robust "is this scene meaningfully different"
//  signal that ignores cursor blinks, antialiasing jitter, and 1px scroll.
//
//  Why this exists: the engine reports whether each visual-context
//  screenshot changed since the previous one, so callers can tell an
//  unchanged screen from new evidence without comparing raw pixels.
